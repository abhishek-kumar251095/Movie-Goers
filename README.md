# Movie-Goers
A web-app for movie recommendations! Users can search for and add movies to their collection. The recommendations are based on the users' existing collection.

This project is my fist attempt at using .NET Core (3.1) and has been made solely for learning purposes. 

Movies can be searched for using any word in the movie-title. The results can be added to the users' collection which is then displayed on the home page. The recommendation feature is still in-progress.

NB: TMDB API has been used for the purpose of searching for movies and getting the details for every movie. The API key is stored in a .env file created in the MovieGoersII project.
