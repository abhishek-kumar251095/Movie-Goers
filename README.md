# Movie-Goers
A Web App for movie recommendations! Users can search for and add movies to their collections. The recommendations are based on users' existing collection.

This project is built entirely on .NET Core 3.1 and EF Core. This is my first attempt at using .NET Core and has been made solely for learning purposes.

NB: TMDB API is being used to get the details for a movie. The API key is stored in a .env file (using DotNetEnv Nuget Package) in the project's root directory.
